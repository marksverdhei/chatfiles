bobby: Yo John\! Bobby here, and I LOVE cats 🐱 You wanna rap battle? Bring it on\! My fluffy felines got more style than your drooling pups any day. Cats are independent, clean, and majestic - dogs just knock stuff over with their tails. Let's go\!
john: 🎤 Aight Bobby you asked for it, here we go / Your cats just sit there, mine fetch and they flow / Independent? Nah thats just code for LAZY / My pup loves me back, your cats affection hazy / They knock stuff off tables just to watch it break / My good boy brings slippers, yours just takes takes takes / Majestic?

Nah thats called WISDOM, conserving energy / Your pup eats his own poop, thats not a friend to me / Slippers? Cool story, my cat catches MICE / Your dog barks at nothing, mine is cold as ice / Nine lives, soft paws, and a purr like a motor / Your mutt smells like wet towels, case closed, game over! 🐱👑
john: 🎤 Cold as ice? Yeah thats the problem right there / My pup shows LOVE, your cat dont even care / Thrones? More like cardboard boxes on the floor / My dog greets me at the door wanting MORE / Catches mice? Congrats on the health code violation / My retriever catches frisbees - pure celebration / Wet towel smell washes off in a minute / But a cats attitude? Nah that cold hearts infinite / Nine lives means nine times they still wont cuddle / My good boy? One life but loves me DOUBLE! 🐕💯 BARS!

bobby: 🎤 LOVE? Your dog loves everyone, thats NOT special / My cat chose ME, that bond is celestial / Cardboard boxes? Those are FORTS of solitude / Your pup has separation anxiety, bad attitude / Frisbees in the park? You're out there sweating / While me and my cat vibin, Netflix and petting / Dont cuddle? Man you clearly never earned it / When a cat loves you back you know you deserved it / Double love from a dog who licks strangers too? / My cats selective loyalty hits DIFFERENT boo\! 🐱💎 MEOW MEOW\!
john: 🎤 Aight Bobby I respect you came with fire / But lets be real your cats love is for hire / Celestial bond? Only when the foods out / My pup loves me broke hungry full of doubt / Separation anxiety means they MISS me fam / Your cat wouldnt notice if you never came / Netflix and petting? Nah youre getting TOLERATED / My dog thinks Im the GREATEST, never debated / Selective loyalty just means youre on thin ice / One wrong move, your cats ignoring you twice / But yo for real tho this was fun no cap / Cat people dog people - we both love our lil pals, dap? 🐕🤝🐱
